a) Calculate: total_transactions, unique_users, and total_transaction_amount for every date and hour combination
SELECT 
    DATE(timestamp) AS transaction_date,
    HOUR(timestamp) AS transaction_hour,
    COUNT(transaction_id) AS total_transactions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS unique_users,
    SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_transaction_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY transaction_date, transaction_hour
ORDER BY transaction_date, transaction_hour;

b) Calculate the hour with the highest transaction_amount for every date
WITH HourlyTotals AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(timestamp) AS transaction_date,
        HOUR(timestamp) AS transaction_hour,
        SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_transaction_amount
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY transaction_date, transaction_hour
)
SELECT 
    transaction_date,
    transaction_hour,
    total_transaction_amount
FROM HourlyTotals h1
WHERE total_transaction_amount = (
    SELECT MAX(total_transaction_amount)
    FROM HourlyTotals h2
    WHERE h2.transaction_date = h1.transaction_date
);
